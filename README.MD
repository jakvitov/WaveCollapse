# Wave collapse algorithm

This repository contains my implementations of the wave collapse algorithm for picture generation.

## Trivial implemention

Is my first implementation of this algorithm. I wrote it in a trivial way with some space left for optimalisations and expansions. My goal is mostly to implement the algorithm simply and understand its basics, before I move on.

## Picture scan implementation

This part is **under construction**. I am trying to implement more advanced approach to the whole wave collapse and generate the rules from a given image and expand it using the wave collapse algo-
